# Review

## Fecal fat dataset

* Lack of digestive enzymes in the intestine can cause bowel absorption problems.
     - This will be indicated by excess fat in the feces. 
     - Pancreatic enzyme supplements can alleviate the problem.
     - fecfat.csv: a study of fecal fat quantity (g/day) for individuals given each of a placebo and 3 types of pills
     
![Fecal Fat dataset](VittinghoffTable71.png)

```{r readdata, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(tidyverse)
  library(ggplot2)
  library(gridExtra)
})
dat <- read.csv("fecfat.csv") %>%
  mutate(pilltype = factor(pilltype, levels = c("none", "tablet", "capsule", "coated"))) %>%
  mutate(subject = factor(subject))
```

## Fecal fat dataset

```{r boxplot, echo=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(dat, aes(pilltype, fecfat)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, aes(size = 1.5), alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_grey(base_size = 22) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(
    angle = 45,
    vjust = 1,
    hjust = 1
  )) +
  xlab("Treatment") + ylab("Fecal Fat (mg/day)")
p2 <-
  ggplot(dat, aes(
    x = pilltype,
    y = fecfat,
    group = subject,
    lty = subject
  )) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  theme_grey(base_size = 22) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(
    angle = 45,
    vjust = 1,
    hjust = 1
  )) +
  xlab("Treatment") + ylab("Fecal Fat (mg/day)")
library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

## Analysis strategies for hierarchical data

* Fixed effects and other non-hierarchical strategies
* Random / mixed effects models
    - model certain regression coefficients (intercept, slopes) as random variables
* Population average models
    - using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)

# Non-hierarchical analysis strategies 

## Non-hierarchical analysis strategies for hierarchical data

* Analyses for each subgroup
    - e.g., look at each patient independently
    - doesn't work at all in this example, and in general is not an integrated analysis of the whole data
    - could sort of work for an example with many patients per doctor, a few doctors
    
* Analysis at the highest level in the hierarchy
    - first summarize data to highest level
    - doesn't work at all in this example
    - could sort of work for an example with few patients per doctor, many doctors

* Analysis on "Derived Variables"
    - consider each treatment type separately, take differences in fat levels between treatment/control for each patient and use paired t-tests
    - can work, but not for unbalanced groups

* Fixed-effects models


## When is hierarchical analysis definitely needed?

1. the correlation structure is of interest, _e.g._ familial aggregation of disease, or consistency of treatment within centers
2. we wish to “borrow strength” across the levels of a hierarchy in order to improve estimates
3. dealing with unbalanced data
4. we want to benefit from software designed for hierarchical data

# Mixed effects models

## Mixed effects models

* Model looks like two-way ANOVA:
$$
FECFAT_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_{subject i} SUBJECT_i + \beta_{pilltype j} PILLTYPE_j + \epsilon_{ij}
$$
     - Assumption: $\epsilon_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)$

* But instead of fitting a $\beta$ to each individual, we assume that the subject effects are selected from a distribution of possible subject effects:
$$
FECFAT_{ij} = \beta_0 + SUBJECT_i + \beta_{pilltype j} PILLTYPE_j + \epsilon_{ij}
$$

Where we assume: $SUBJECT_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0, \tau_{00}^2)$

* This is a *mixed effects* model because:
    - the "true" intercept varies randomly from patient to patient
    - the "true" (population) coefficient of treatment is fixed (the same for everyone)

## Fit this mixed-effects model

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(nlme)
fitmix <- nlme::lme(fecfat ~ pilltype, 
                    data = dat, 
                    random =  ~ 1 | subject)
```

\tiny 

Note: the `lme4` package is another popular alternative

## Mixed effects model coeffients, variances, ICC

```{r, echo=FALSE}
##Shortcut for calculating ICC from an lme object:
ICClme <- function(out) {
  varests <- as.numeric(VarCorr(out)[1:2])
  varests[1] / sum(varests)
}
```

\tiny
```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
fitmix
```

$ICC = 15.9^2 / (15.9^2 + 10.34^2)$ = `r round(15.9^2 / (15.9^2 + 10.34^2), 2)` = `r round(ICClme(fitmix), 2)`.

\normalsize

* Recall ICC is a measure of how large the subject effect is, in relation to the error term
* Variances were estimated directly by the model!

## Assumptions of the mixed model

$$
FECFAT_{ij} = \beta_0 + SUBJECT_i + \beta_{pilltype j} PILLTYPE_j + \epsilon_{ij}
$$

* Normally distributed residuals as in fixed effects model: 
    - $\epsilon_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)$
* Normally distributed **latent variable**:
    - $SUBJECT_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0, \tau_{00}^2)$

## Mixed effects model results

A plot of the random intercept:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(cex = 2)
plot(ranef(fitmix), cex = 2)
```

## Mixed effects model diagnostics
``
```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), cex = 1.5)
qqnorm(residuals(fitmix, type = "pearson"), main = "QQ plot residuals")
qqline(residuals(fitmix, type = "pearson"))
qqnorm(ranef(fitmix)[, 1], main = "QQ plot random intercepts")
qqline(ranef(fitmix)[, 1])
```

## Mixed effects model results

\tiny
```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(fitmix)
```
\normalsize

* Note: correlation of the estimator of the fixed effects
    + high correlations may (but not necessarily) be due to collinearity
    + not usually useful, not included in output of some packages

## Mixed effects model results

Inference for variance terms (and fixed effects):
\tiny
```{r, echo=FALSE}
intervals(fitmix)
```
\normalsize

* Would conclude that variation of the intercept between subjects is non-zero
    + not attributable to within-subject variation

     
# Longitudinal data

## Longitudinal data

* Interested in the change in the value of a variable within a "subject"
* Collect data repeatedly through time. 
* For hierarchical longitudinal analysis to be effective, before/after measurements need to be positively correlated

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(nlme)
fitmix <- nlme::lme(fecfat ~ pilltype, 
                    data = dat, 
                    random =  ~ 1 | subject)
```

## Longitudinal data

* Interested in the change in the value of a variable within a “subject” 
* Collect data repeatedly through time. 
* For hierarchical longitudinal analysis to be effective, before/after measurements need to be positively correlated

## Longitudinal data examples

* Example 1: a measure of sleepiness before and after administration of treatment or placebo
* Example 2: Study of Osteoporotic Fractores (SOF dataset)
     - 9,704 women tracked with clinical visits every two years
     - Bone Mineral Density (BMD), Body Mass Index (BMI), many other variables
* Questions for Example 2:
     1. Is change in BMD related to age at menopause?  This is a time-invariant predictor, age at menopause, with time-dependent changes in the outcome, BMD.
     2. Is change in BMD related to change in BMI? This is an analysis relating a time-varying predictor, BMI, with changes in the outcome, BMD. BMI varies quite a lot between women, but also varies within a woman over time.

## Longitudinal data examples

* birthweight and birth order
* provides birthweights and order of infants from mothers who had 5 children in Georgia
     - interested in whether birthweight of babies changes with order
     - whether this difference depends on the _mother's age at first childbirth_ or on the _weight of initial baby_.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ga <- read_csv("gababies.csv") %>%
  mutate(momage = na_if(momage, 99)) %>%
  mutate(agebin = cut(initage, breaks = c(0, 20, 100))) %>%
  mutate(momid = factor(momid)) %>%
  mutate(lowbrth = recode_factor(lowbrth, `0` = "normal", `1` = "low"))
```

## Georgia Birthweights dataset

Boxplot and "Spaghetti" plot:
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(ga, aes(x = birthord, group = birthord, y = bweight)) +
  geom_boxplot(notch = FALSE, outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(width=0.2, col = "black", alpha = 0.25) +
  theme_grey(base_size = 22) + 
  labs(subtitle = "Georgia birthweight dataset") +
  xlab("Birth order") + ylab("Birth Weight (g)")
p2 <- ggplot(ga, aes(x = birthord, y = bweight, group = momid)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.25) +
  theme_grey(base_size = 22) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(subtitle = "Georgia birthweight dataset") +
  xlab("Birth order") + ylab("Birth Weight (g)")
library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=2)
```

## Georgia Birthweights dataset

* Does baseline birth weight vary by mother?
     + random intercept

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(nlme)
gafit1 <- lme(bweight ~ birthord, data=ga, 
              random=~1|momid)
```

Note: there are not enough degrees of freedom to also fit a random coefficient for birth order

## Georgia Birthweights dataset
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(ranef(gafit1))
```

## Georgia Birthweights dataset
\tiny
```{r}
summary(gafit1)
```

## Georgia Birthweights dataset

\tiny
```{r}
intervals(gafit1, which = "all")
```
\normalsize

* Does baseline birth weight vary by mother?
    - yes: the subject variance is significantly greater than zero
    - The variance between mothers is too much to be explained by within-mother variation in birth weights

# Population Average Models

## Population Average Models

* An alternative to random / mixed-effects models that is more robust to assumptions of:
    - distribution of random effects
    - correlation structure

* Estimates correlation structure from the data rather than assuming normality    
    - Requires more clusters than observations per cluster

* Estimates regression coefficients and robust standard errors
    - commonly by Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)

## Population Average Models

* Compare mixed model multiple linear regression:
$$
E[Y_{ij}|X_{ij}] = \beta_0 + \alpha_{0j} + \beta_1 X_{ij}, \alpha_{0j} \sim N(0, \sigma)
$$
for subject $i$ in group $j$.

* to a population average model:
$$
E[Y_{ij}|X_{ij}] = \beta_0^* + \beta_1^* X_{ij}
$$

* Interpretations of $\beta^*$ and $\beta$ are equivalent
* Numerically equivalent for linear and log-linear models (if specification of mixed model is correct), but not for logistic link.


## Fit a population average model

```{r, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
gafit.gee <- gee::gee(bweight ~ birthord,
                      corstr = "exchangeable",
                      id = momid,
                      data = ga)
```

##   

\tiny

```{r}
summary(gafit.gee)
```


## Correlation assumptions for GEE

Must make some assumption about the form of correlation among grouped observations. Some options are:

* Independence:
    - no correlation between measurements within group
* Exchangeable:
    - all pairwise correlations are the same (in large-N limit)
    - nothing distinguishes one member of a cluster from another
    - appropriate in the absence of other data structures such as measurements taken through time or space
* Auto-regressive (_AR-M_):
    - observations taken more closely in time are more highly correlated

## Correlation assumptions for GEE (cont'd)

* Unstructured:
    - estimates a separate correlation between observations taken on each pair of "times"
* Non-stationary ("non_stat_M_dep"):
    - similar to unstructured, but assumes all correlations for pairs separated far enough in time are zero
* Stationary ("stat_M_dep"):
    - e.g. stationary of order 2: observations taken at time points 1 and 3 have the same correlation as time points 2 and 4
    - but this might be different from the correlation between observations taken at times 2 and 3
    - correlations for observations 3 or more time periods apart assumed to be zero

*Fewer assumptions requires more data, and good assumptions improve results*

## Help in choosing a method

![Hierarchical modeling decision table from Moen _et al._](journal.pone.0146721.t002.PNG)

## Conclusions

* Ignoring within-subject correlations can produce very wrong results, and is not always "conservative"
* Hierarchical analysis strategies are needed for any of:
     1. When the correlation structure is of primary interest, _e.g._ familial aggregation of disease, or consistency of treatment within centers,
     2. When we wish to “borrow strength” across the levels of a hierarchy in order to improve estimates, and
     3. When dealing with unbalanced correlated data.  E.g., no requirement that each Georgia mother have exactly 5 children.
* Population average models provide a robust alternative to mixed models
    - for one level of hierarchy

## A final note on reporting results of hypothesis tests

* Include test statistic, a measure of "effect size", and test name if unclear from test statistic
* Write in plain language and let the statistics support, not lead. E.g.:
    + _do_: The 36 study participants had a mean age of 27.4 (SD = 12.6), significantly older than the university mean of 21.2 years (t(35) = 2.95, p = 0.01).
    + _don't_: A p-value of 0.01 indicated significant difference in age of study participants compared to all university students.
    + _do_: report confidence intervals where possible
