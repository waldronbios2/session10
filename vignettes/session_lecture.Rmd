# Learning objectives and outline

## Learning objectives

1. define mixed effects models and population average models
2. perform model diagnostics for random effects models
3. interpret random intercepts and random slopes

## Outline

1. topic 1

* Vittinghoff sections 7.2, 7.3, 7.5

# Review

## Recall the simple repeated measures example: fecal fat

* Lack of digestive enzymes in the intestine can cause bowel absorption problems.
     - This will be indicated by excess fat in the feces. 
     - Pancreatic enzyme supplements can alleviate the problem.
     - fecfat.csv: a study of fecal fat quantity (g/day) for individuals given each of a placebo and 3 types of pills
     
![Fecal Fat dataset](VittinghoffTable71.png)

```{r readdata, echo=FALSE}
fecfat <- read.csv("fecfat.csv")
fecfat$pilltype <- factor(fecfat$pilltype, levels=c("none", "tablet", "capsule", "coated"))
fecfat$subject <- factor(fecfat$subject)
```

## Fecal fat dataset

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, warning=FALSE}
fecfat$fecfatminusmean <- residuals(lm(fecfat ~ subject, data=fecfat))
par(mfrow=c(1,2), cex=1.35)
library(RColorBrewer)
# colors from display.brewer.all(n=3)
mycols <- c("white", brewer.pal(n=3, "Pastel2"))
boxplot(fecfat ~ pilltype, data=fecfat,
        notch=TRUE,
        col=mycols, 
        xlab="Treatment", ylab="Fecal Fat (mg/day)")
stripchart(fecfat ~ pilltype, data=fecfat, vertical=TRUE, pch=20,
           method="jitter", jitter=0.1, add=TRUE)
interaction.plot(x.factor=fecfat$pilltype, 
                 trace.factor=fecfat$subject, 
                 response=fecfat$fecfat, 
                 xlab="Treatment", ylab="Fecal Fat (mg/day)",
                 legend=FALSE)
```

## Analysis strategies for hierarchical data

* Analyses for each subgroup
    - e.g., look at each patient independently
    - doesn't work at all in this example, and in general is not an integrated analysis of the whole data
    - could sort of work for an example with many patients per doctor, a few doctors
    
* Analysis at the highest level in the hierarchy
    - first summarize data to highest level
    - doesn't work at all in this example
    - could sort of work for an example with many patients per doctor, a few doctors

* Analysis on "Derived Variables"
    - consider each treatment type separately, take differences in fat levels between treatment/control for each patient and use paired t-tests
    - can work, but not work for unbalanced groups (e.g. incomplete data for some participants)

## Better analysis strategies for hierarchical data

* Fixed effects models
* Random / mixed effects models
    - model certain regression coefficients (intercept, slopes) as random variables
* Population average models
    - using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)

## When is hierarchical analysis needed?

* Hierarchical analysis strategies are needed:
     1. when the correlation structure is of primary interest, _e.g._ familial aggregation of disease, or consistency of treatment within centers,
     2. when we wish to “borrow strength” across the levels of a hierarchy in order to improve estimates, and
     3. when dealing with unbalanced, correlated data.

# Fixed effects: two-way analysis of variance

*# Two-way ANOVA (person $i$ with pill type $j$):
$$
FECFAT_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_{subject i} SUBJECT_i + \beta_{pilltype j} PILLTYPE_j + \epsilon_{ij}
$$
Assumption: $\epsilon_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)$

\footnotesize

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(xtable)
fit2 <- lm(fecfat ~ subject + pilltype, data=fecfat)
print(xtable(anova(fit2), caption="Two-way analysis of variance table.  Equivalent to subtracting the mean fecal fat content for each individual."), comment=FALSE)
```

\normalsize
* Accounts for individual differences in mean fecal fat
* Fits a coefficient for mean fecal fat per indivudual


# Mixed effects models

## Mixed effects models

* Model looks like two-way ANOVA:
$$
FECFAT_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_{subject i} SUBJECT_i + \beta_{pilltype j} PILLTYPE_j + \epsilon_{ij}
$$
     - Assumption: $\epsilon_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)$

* But instead of fitting a $\beta$ to each individual, we assume that the subject effects are selected from a distribution of possible subject effects:
$$
FECFAT_{ij} = \beta_0 + SUBJECT_i + \beta_{pilltype j} PILLTYPE_j + \epsilon_{ij}
$$

Where we assume: $SUBJECT_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0, \tau_{00}^2)$

* This is a *mixed effects* model because:
    - the "true" intercept varies randomly from patient to patient
    - the "true" (population) coefficient of treatment is fixed (the same for everyone)

## Mixed effects model coeffients, variances, ICC

```{r, echo=FALSE}
##Shortcut for calculating ICC from an lme object:
ICClme <- function(out){
  varests <- as.numeric(VarCorr(out)[1:2])
  varests[1] / sum(varests)
}
```

\tiny
```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(nlme)
fitmix <- nlme::lme(fecfat ~ pilltype, data=fecfat, random=~1|subject)
fitmix
```

$ICC = 15.9^2 / (15.9^2 + 10.34^2)$ = `r round(15.9^2 / (15.9^2 + 10.34^2), 2)` = `r round(ICClme(fitmix), 2)`.

\normalsize

* Recall ICC is a measure of how large the subject effect is, in relation to the error term
* Variances were estimated directly by the model!

## Assumptions of the mixed model

$$
FECFAT_{ij} = \beta_0 + SUBJECT_i + \beta_{pilltype j} PILLTYPE_j + \epsilon_{ij}
$$

* Normally distributed residuals as in fixed effects model: 
    - $\epsilon_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)$
* Normally distributed **latent variable**:
    - $SUBJECT_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0, \tau_{00}^2)$

## Mixed effects model results

A plot of the random intercept:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(cex=2)
plot(ranef(fitmix), cex=2)
```

## Mixed effects model diagnostics

```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,2), cex=1.5)
qqnorm(residuals(fitmix, type="pearson"), main="QQ plot residuals")
qqline(residuals(fitmix, type="pearson"))
qqnorm(ranef(fitmix)[, 1], main="QQ plot random intercepts")
qqline(ranef(fitmix)[, 1])
```

## Mixed effects model results

\tiny
```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(fitmix)
```
\normalsize

* Note: correlation of the estimator of the fixed effects
    + high correlations may (but not necessarily) be due to collinearity
    + not usually useful, not included in output of some packages

## Mixed effects model results

Inference for variance terms (and fixed effects):
\tiny
```{r, echo=FALSE}
intervals(fitmix)
```
\normalsize

* Would conclude that variation of the intercept between subjects is non-zero
    + not attributable to within-subject variation

     
# Longitudinal data

## Longitudinal data

* Interested in the change in the value of a variable within a “subject” 
* Collect data repeatedly through time. 
* For hierarchical longitudinal analysis to be effective, before/after measurements need to be positively correlated

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(nlme)
fitmix <- nlme::lme(fecfat ~ pilltype, data=fecfat, random=~1|subject)
```

## Longitudinal data

* Interested in the change in the value of a variable within a “subject” 
* Collect data repeatedly through time. 
* For hierarchical longitudinal analysis to be effective, before/after measurements need to be positively correlated

## Longitudinal data examples

* Example 1: a measure of sleepiness before and after administration of treatment or placebo
* Example 2: Study of Osteoporotic Fractores (SOF dataset)
     - 9,704 women tracked with clinical visits every two years
     - Bone Mineral Density (BMD), Body Mass Index (BMI), many other variables
* Questions for Example 2:
     1. Is change in BMD related to age at menopause?  This is a time-invariant predictor, age at menopause, with time-dependent changes in the outcome, BMD.
     2. Is change in BMD related to change in BMI? This is an analysis relating a time-varying predictor, BMI, with changes in the outcome, BMD. BMI varies quite a lot between women, but also varies within a woman over time.

## Longitudinal data examples

* birthweight and birth order
* provides birthweights and order of infants from mothers who had 5 children in Georgia
     - interested in whether birthweight of babies changes with order
     - whether this difference depends on the _mother's age at first childbirth_ or on the _weight of initial baby_.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ga <- read.csv("gababies.csv")
ga$momage[ga$momage==99] <- NA
ga$agebin <- cut(ga$initage, breaks=c(0, 20, 100))
##ga <- ga[ga$birthord %in% c(1, 5), ]
ga$momid=factor(ga$momid)
ga$lowbrth=factor(ga$lowbrth, levels=0:1, labels=c("normal", "low"))
```

## Georgia Birthweights dataset

"Spaghetti" plot:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
interaction.plot(x.factor=ga$birthord, 
                 trace.factor=ga$momid, 
                 response=ga$bweight, 
                 xlab="Birth Order", ylab="Birth Weight (g)",
                 legend=FALSE)
```

## Georgia Birthweights dataset

* Do birth weights or the effect of birth order vary by mother?
     + random intercept, random slope

```{r}
gafit1 <- nlme::lme(bweight ~ birthord, data=ga, 
    random=~birthord|momid,
    na.action=na.omit,
    control=list(msMaxIter=600, msMaxEval=600, 
                 sing.tol=1e-20, msVerbose=FALSE))  
```

Note: the control argument increases the max # iterations to allow convergence. If `msVerbose=TRUE`, it produces verbose output.

## Georgia Birthweights dataset
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(ranef(gafit1))
```

## Georgia Birthweights dataset
\tiny
```{r}
summary(gafit1)
```

## Georgia Birthweights dataset

\tiny
```{r}
intervals(gafit1)
```
\normalsize

* Do birth weights or the effect of birth order vary by mother?
    - yes: both standard deviations are non-zero

# Population Average Models

## Population Average Models

* An alternative to random / mixed-effects models that is more robust to assumptions of:
    - distribution of random effects
    - correlation structure

* Estimates correlation structure from the data rather than assuming normality    
    - Requires a fair bit more clusters than observations per cluster

* Estimates regression coefficients and robust standard errors
    - commonly by Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)

## Population Average Models

* Compare mixed model multiple linear regression:
$$
E[Y_{ij}|X_{ij}] = \beta_0 + \alpha_{0j} + \beta_1 X_{ij}, \alpha_{0j} \sim N(0, \sigma)
$$
for subject $i$ in group $j$.

* to a population average model:
$$
E[Y_{ij}|X_{ij}] = \beta_0^* + \beta_1^* X_{ij}
$$

* Interpretations of $\beta^*$ and $\beta$ are equivalent
* Numerically equivalent for linear and log-linear models (if specification of mixed model is correct), but not for logistic link.


## Fit a population average model

\tiny
```{r, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
gafit.gee <- gee::gee(bweight ~ birthord, corstr="exchangeable",
                      id=momid, data=ga)
```
```{r}
summary(gafit.gee)
```


## GEE working correlation types

* Must make some assumption about form correlation among observations from the same subject, same hospital, etc

* Independence
    - no correlation between measurements within group
* Exchangeable
    - all correlations (except those variables with themselves) are a common value
    - nothing to distinguish one member of a cluster from another
    - appropriate in the absence of other data structures such as measurements taken through time or space
* Auto-regressive
    - observations taken more closely in time are more highly correlated

## GEE working correlation types

* Unstructured
    - estimates a separate correlation between observations taken on each pair of "times"
* Non-stationary
    - similar to unstructured, but assumes all correlations for pairs separated far enough in time are zero
* Stationary
    - e.g. stationary of order 2: observations taken at time points 1 and 3 have the same correlation as time points 2 and 4
    - but this might be different from the correlation between observations taken at times 2 and 3
    - correlations for observations 3 or more time periods apart assumed to be zero

*Fewer assumptions requires more data, and good assumptions improve results*

## Help in choosing a method

## Conclusions

* Ignoring within-subject correlations can produce very wrong results, and is not always "conservative"
* Hierarchical analysis strategies are needed for any of:
     1. When the correlation structure is of primary interest, _e.g._ familial aggregation of disease, or consistency of treatment within centers,
     2. When we wish to “borrow strength” across the levels of a hierarchy in order to improve estimates, and
     3. When dealing with unbalanced correlated data.  E.g., no requirement that each Georgia mother have exactly 5 children.
* Population average models provide a robust alternative to mixed models
    - for one level of hierarchy
